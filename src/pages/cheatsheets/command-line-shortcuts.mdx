When I recorded this video, I thought the shortcut <code>CTRL+U</code> was deleting the line, but it's just cutting the whole line, you can paste the text with <code>CTRL+Y</code>.

## Shortcuts for moving around

Let's be honest how many times do we write a command, just to notice that around the beginning of the line there is a mistake and we delete everything and type the command again? These shortcuts will help you move the cursor easier without the need to delete the whole thing.

- `CTRL + A` - Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
- `CTRL + E` - Moves the cursor to the end of the line
- `CTRL + arrow keys` - Moves the cursor from word to word 
- `ALT + B` - Moves the cursor back from word to word
- `ALT + F` - Moves cursors forward from word to word


## Cutting and pasting


- `CTRL + W` - Cut the word left of the cursor
- `CTRL + K` - Cut the entire text at the right of the cursor
- `CTRL + U` - Cut the entire line
- `CTRL + Y` - Paste the previous cut text
- `ALT  + W` - Cut the entire text at the left of the cursor

## Text manipulation

- `CTRL + T` - Swap two letters between the cursor
  - Example: `this` if the cursor is between the **h** and **i** it turns into `tihs`
- `ESC + T` - Swap two words between the cursor
  - Example: `this text` will become `text this`
- `ESC + U` - Uppercases text right of the cursor - moves cursor to the end of word
- `CTRL + Q` - Deletes text from line - clears line only

## Other useful shortcuts

- `CTRL + L` - Clears the terminal -> No need to write `clear` all the time!
- `CTRL + R` - Reverse search your history for a term
  - Use `CTRL + R` again to cycle through results
- `!!` Repeat the last command used in the terminal
- Use `sudo !!` to repeat the last command with `sudo`
