This cheatsheet will have more code snippets on how to do something in bash. It will be a bit different from some other cheatsheets where I show a list of commands.

## Basics

- `echo` - print text to the terminal
  - `echo Hello world!` - prints 'Hello world!'

### Variables

- `COLOR="green"` - create variable `COLOR` and set it to green, you can then use it such as:
  - `echo $COLOR`
  - `echo "$COLOR"`
  - `echo "${COLOR}"`
  - `echo "My favourite color is $COLOR!"`

<Note>
  You need to use double quotes if you want to print text and variable. Using <code>echo 'my favourite color is $COLOR'</code> would print <code>my favourite color is $COLOR </code> to the terminal 
</Note>

### Arrays

- `COLORS=("red", "green", "blue")` - Define an array of colors
- `echo ${COLORS[0]}` - Print first element in the array
- `echo ${COLORS[-1]}` - Print last element in the array
- `echo ${COLORS[@]}` - Prints all elements separated by a space
- `echo ${#COLORS[@]}` - Prints the number of elements in the array

### Loops

For loops:

```bash
for item in ${MYLIST[@]}; do
  echo $item
done
```

```bash
for ((i=0; i < 10; i++)); do
  echo $i
done
```

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Iteration number: $i"
done
```

While loop: 

```bash
while true; do
  echo "HELLO!"
done
```


### Conditionals

Conditionals follow the familiar if statements:

```bash
if [ $COLOR != "green" ]; then
  echo "Your favourite color isn't green"
fi
```

You can use `[[ ... ]]` to get a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression inside ``[[]]``.

- `[[ -z STRING ]]` - Empty string
- `[[ -n STRING ]]` - Not empty string
- `[[ -e FILE ]]` - File exists
- `[[ -r FILE ]]` - File is readable
- `[[ -d PATH ]]` - PATH is a directory
- `[[ -w FILE ]]` - File is writeable
- `[[ -s FILE ]]` - File size is larger than 0 bytes
- `[[ -x FILE ]]` - File is executable
- `[[ STRING == STRING ]]` - Both strings are equal
- `[[ STRING != STRING ]]` - Strings aren't equal
- `[[ STRING =~ STRING ]]` - Test STRING against a regex pattern
- `[[ NUM -eq NUM]]` - Both numbers are equal
- `[[ NUM -ne NUM ]]` - Numbers aren't equal
- `[[ NUM -lt NUM ]]` - First NUM is less than second NUM
- `[[ NUM -le NUM ]]` - First NUM is less or equal than second NUM
- `[[ NUM -gt NUM ]]` - First NUM is greater than second NUM
- `[[ NUM -ge NUM ]]` - First NUM is greater or equal than second NUM
- `[[ ! EXPRESSION ]]` - Not
- `[[ EXPRESSION && EXPRESSION ]]` - And 
- `[[ EXPRESSION || EXPRESSION ]]` - Or
