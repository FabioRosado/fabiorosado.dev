> "At the software-architecture level, the complexity of a problem is reduced by dividing the system into subsystems."

> "The goal of all software-design techniques is to break a complicated problem into simple pieces."

> The steps in designing with objects are
>
> - Identify the objects and their attributes (methods and data).
> - Determine what can be done to each object.
> - Determine what each object is allowed to do to other objects.
> - Determine the parts of each object that will be visible to other objects - which parts will be public and which will be private.
> - Define each object's public interface.

> "When software-project surveys report causes of project failure, they rarely identify technical reasons as the primary causes of project failure."

> "Projects fail most often because of poor requirements, poor planning, or poor management. But when projects do fail for reasons that are primarily technical, the reason is often uncontrolled complexity."
