## How to program Deliberately

Programming deliberately allows you to catch, fix errors early and helps you write better code. By programming deliberately you should:

<Quote>
  <ul>
    <li> Always be aware of what you are doing.</li>
    <li> (...) explain the code, in detail</li>
    <li>
      {" "}
      Don't code in the dark. Build an application you don't fully grasp, or use
      a technology you don't understand.
    </li>
    <li> Proceed from a plan (...)</li>
    <li> Rely only on reliable things. Don't depend on assumptions.</li>
    <li> Document your assumptions</li>
    <li>
      {" "}
      Don't just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don't guess;
    </li>
    <li> Prioritize your effort. Spend time on important aspects.</li>
    <li>
      {" "}
      (...) Don't let existing code dictate future core. All code can be replaced
      if its no longer appropriate.
    </li>
  </ul>
</Quote>

## Scoping and planning

<Quote>
  That's what we do. When given something that seems simple, we annoy people by
  looking for edge cases and asking about them.

<Quote>
  Another big danger in producing a requirements document is being too specific.
</Quote>

<Quote>
  Requirements are not architecture. Requirements are not design, nor are they
  the user interface. Requirements are need.
</Quote>

<Quote>
  These short descriptions are often called user stories. They describe what a
  small portion of the application should do from the perspective of a user of
  that functionality.
</Quote>
