## How to program Deliberately 

Programming deliberately allows you to catch, fix errors early and helps you write better code. By programming deliberately you should:

<Quote>
    <ul>
        <li> Always be aware of what you are doing.</li>
        <li> (...) explain the code, in detail</li>
        <li> Don't code in the dark. Build an application you don't fully grasp, or use a technology you don't understand.</li>
        <li> Proceed from a plan (...)</li>
        <li> Rely only on reliable things. Don't depend on assumptions.</li>
        <li> Document your assumptions</li>
        <li> Don't just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don't guess;</li>
        <li> Prioritize your effort. Spend time on important aspects.</li>
        <li> (...) Don't let existing code dictate future core. All code can be replaced if its no longer appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
