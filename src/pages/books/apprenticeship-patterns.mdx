This is an excellent book that talks about different patterns that you can implement in your day to day to become a software craftsman.

## Going through different levels

The book starts by describing the three levels of craftsmanship:

- Apprenticeship
- Journeyman
- Master

These three levels are great because you can see exactly where you may be in your journey and what you need to do to achieve the next level. At a high level:

- Apprentices need to learn how to learn, grow themselves and get mentoring from the two other levels.
- Journeymen focus on connections within and outside the team, mentor those around themselves and build a larger portfolio to show progress.
- Masters focus on moving the industry forward, enhancing the skills of others, creating tools for others to use, training journeymen and apprentices.

## Learning a language

This section offers great advice if you want to apply for a job that uses a particular language. You should build a toy application using that language and open source it so your prospective employer can see a sample of your work.

It also mentions that:

One of the fundamental ways to improve the experience of learning your first language is to have an actual problem to solve.

This section also mentions that once you learn your first language, you should look for opportunities to learn languages that take a different approach than the ones you already know.

Apprentices comfortable with an object-oriented language should explore a functional programming language

## Steps after getting the first job

The book also offers great tips on what you should do once you get your first job. The one thing that stuck with me was that a path might take you to management. If that's the path, you want to take, great! But if you're going to become better at your craft, you should seek opportunities to learn and keep practising so you can grow.
