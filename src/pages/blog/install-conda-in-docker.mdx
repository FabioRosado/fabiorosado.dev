import Note from "../../components/text-decorations/note"


While working at coiled, I came across the need to install conda in a docker image that didn't come pre-packed with conda.  When you create a [software environment](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/software_environment.html) in coiled, we will create a new image based on one of the two:

- Your image if provided by the `container` argument
- Our base image

In this software environment, we install all the dependencies you specify with the command `coiled.create_software_environment`. If we provide an image that doesn't have conda installed, then creating the software environment will fail if we try to install a dependency with conda. For example:

```python
import coiled

coiled.create_software_environment(name="conda-test", conda=["dask"])

```


## Installing conda in docker

Let's see how you can install conda into a docker image. We will need to create a new `Dockerfile` and decide which python version we will use.  Then we need to go to the [miniconda installation page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and choose one of the Linux installers for your python version.

<Note>
    <p>In this article, I will use the Python 3.8 installer, which has the name <code>Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</code></p>
</Note>

Let's go ahead and create our Dockerfile. I will add as many commands inside a single `RUN` command because that makes the final image smaller.

```Dockerfile
FROM <your image without conda>

# Install base utilities
RUN apt-get update \
	&& apt-get install -y build-essential \
	&& apt-get install -y wget \
	&& apt-get clean \
	&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install miniconda
ENV CONDA_DIR /opt/conda
RUN wget --quiet https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh && \
    /bin/bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p /opt/conda

# Put conda in path so we can use conda activate
ENV PATH=$CONDA_DIR/bin:$PATH

```

We can now build this image. This image will have all the things your original image has plus conda, allowing coiled to install the dependencies without problems.
