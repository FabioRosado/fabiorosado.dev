excerpt: Keeping your dependencies up to date is not always straightforward, let me share with you how you can keep all your dependencies update by running two commands.

Today I had to work on project that was 1 year old and a lot of the dependencies where outdated.  

We can run the command `npm outdated` to get a list of all the dependencies that have new releases.

We then need a way to update them all, thatâ€™s when another package called `npm-check-updates` comes in handy. This package will upgrade the package.json versions of all outdated dependences.

```shell
npm install -g npm-check-updates
```

_Note: You should install this package globally so you can use on other projects._

After installing the package you need to run `ncu -u`  on your terminal to upgrade  your package.json.

Finally you can run the command `npm update` to update your dependencies.
