Nx makes it easier to work with monorepos, to and libraries that could share code between different apps. Nx also generates unit and e2e tests, it prepares bundling and code-splitting with Webpack. 

I've come in contact with Nx when I created notes for the [egghead course - Scale React Development with Nx](https://egghead.io/playlists/scale-react-development-with-nx-4038) by Juri Strumpflohner. I'd recommend you to watch this free course. What I am going to share here, is just some of the notes that I took.

## Nx Workspace

A workspace contains different files and folders.

- `Apps` folder - contains all the applications we want to host
- `Libs` folder - contains all the code, usually, applications will link to code inside this folder
- A single `node_modules` folder for the workspace
- The `package.json` serves as the global file for packages for the whole workspace
- `workspace.json` contains all the configuration of your projects and how to build it
- `nx.json` contains the configuration of the workspace

### Installing Nx and Creating a workspace

To install Nx on your machine you can run the command: 

```shell
npm install -g nx
```

Or

```shell
yarn global add nx
```

Then you can create and configure a new Nx workspace with the command:

```shell
npx create-nx-workspace <workspace name>
```

When you run this command, the CLI will give you a set of options that allows you to create the best workspace for your needs.

- empty
- oss
- web components
- angular
- angular-nest
- react
- react-express

You will also be asked which CLI should be activated in this workspace. The `Angular CLI` or the `Nx CLI` which is used for any workspace.

<Note>
  You can append the flag <code>--dry-run</code> to each command, to see what a command will do, without actual changes to your workspace.
</Note>

## Creating a new App

You can generate apps by using plugins for your Nx CLI. The egghead course is using React so this is what I am going to use. I am also going to be using `yarn` in these examples, but you could use `npm` instead.

First, we need to install the react plugin with the command:

```shell
yarn add @nrwl/react
```
<Note>
  You can run the command <code>yarn list @nrwl/react</code> to see all the things you can do with this plugin.
</Note>

After the plugin is installed, you can run the following command to generate a new app.

```shell
yarn nx generate @nrwl/react:application <name>
```

You can also replace `generate` for `g` to make this command a bit shorter.


## Creating a React Library

To generate a library to be used inside an application, you can run the following command:

```shell
yarn nx g @nrwl/react:lib <name of library>
```

When dealing with monorepos, organizing your workspace is important. So you can append the flag `--directory=<name of directory>` to put new libraries inside a directory that contain the name of the app that will be using this library.


## Installing npm packages in an Nx workpsace

Since you are using a monorepo, you will have a global `package.json` which means that you can install your packages as normal, by running the command:

```shell
yarn add <package name>
```

## Creating a React Component

When generating a component, you can add the flag `--project=<path and name of the library>` to specify which library should use this component. Let's assume that you have a library called `my-awesome-lib` and you are creating the component `header` you need to set the project flag like such: `--project=my-awesome-lib-header`.

```shell
yarn nx g @nrwl/react:component <name of component> --project=<name of library>
```

Now that you have the component created, how can you import it?

Have a look at the `tsconfig.base.json` file, look for the `paths` parameter and you can use that to import your components.

For example:

```js
import { Header } from @my-workspace/my-awesome-lib/header
```

## Visualising your Monorepo Structure

Nx comes with a visual tool that will create a graph containing all your dependencies and how each thing relates to another.

```shell
yarn nx dep-graph
```

A few things that are good to know about the graph representation of your project:

- Applications are represented by squares
- Libraries are represented by circles
- The arrows show the libraries that an application imports

## Running Commands, tests and linting

When you create a workspace, Nx will set up a few things for you - tests, linting and any other needed commands.

To run a command it's as easy as:

```shell
yarn run <app/lib name>:<command>
```

For example, you can run tests with the command `yarn run my-awesome-app:test`.

What if you want to run a command in more than one application/library? Nx has you covered as well.

```shell
yarn nx run-many --target=<command> --projects=<app/lib separated by comman> --parallel=<boolean>
```

That's a lot of flags! Let's have a look at them:

- `--target` is the type of command we want to run - we want to use serve to run both applications
- `--projects` these are all the applications we want to run in the command, they are comma-separated
- `--parallel` is used because we want to serve both projects together at the same time
  - If we don't use it, Nx would run the first project until terminated, before starting the next one

Let's see an example. If we want to run the frontend and backend of our `awesome-project` we can use the command:

```shell
yarn nx run-many --target=serve --projects=awesome-frontend,awesome-backend --parallel=true
```

We have to use the `--parallel` flag because we want to run both the backend and frontend at the same time.

## Improving CI runs

When working with monorepos and as our workspace grows, the slower CI will be. Nx provides an `affected` command that will build only the things that have changed.

```shell
yarn nx affected:<target> --base=<branch - defaults main>
```

For example, you can run only the tests for only the files that changed in our app with the command:

```shell
yarn nx affected:test
```

<Note>
  We can skip the <code>--base</code> flag since it will default to the main branch.
</Note>
