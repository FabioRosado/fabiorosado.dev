A user asked a [question in the pyscript community discord](https://discord.com/channels/972017612454232116/972020206538997822/1042051056630247456) saying that when trying to use pyscript in a NextJS app, the following would occur:

```python
PythonError: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/lib/python3.10/asyncio/futures.py", line 201, in result raise self._exception File "/lib/python3.10/asyncio/tasks.py", line 232, in step result = coro.send(None) File "/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_pyodide/_base.py", line 506, in eval_code_async await CodeRunner( File "/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_pyodide/_base.py", line 241, in init__ self.ast = next(self._gen) File "/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_pyodide/_base.py", line 142, in _parse_and_compile_gen mod = compile(source, filename, mode, flags | ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST) File "", line 1 for i in range(9): print(i) def func(): print('function works') ^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

From the exception, the code was all in the same line; this was odd. After asking for the code, the user said that the code looked like this:

```python
<py-script>
for i in range(9):
   print(i)

def func():
   print('function works')
</py-script>
```

Something was stripping all the white spaces. If you know Python, indentation is part of the language, so if we strip whitespaces Python will throw a `SyntaxError` - this was exactly what was happening

## Setting up Pyscript

Before we dig into how to solve the above problem, let's first see how to install PyScript. If you go to [pyscript.net](https://pyscript.net) you can get the needed scripts to install pyscript. The user was using NextJS, and NextJS allows you to create a `_document` file so you can create a custom document. [See the docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document). All you need to do is add this file to your `pages` folder.

```tsx
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
import Script from "next/script"

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/latest/pyscript.css" />
        <Script defer src="https://pyscript.net/latest/pyscript.js" strategy='beforeInteractive'/>
        </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  )
}
```

Then we can add the `py-script` tag in the `index.tsx` file to start playing with pyscript.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
	<div>
		<py-script>
			for i in range(9):
			   print(i)
			
			def func():
			   print('function works')
		</py-script>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Digging into the problem

Now that we have pyscript installed, we can start looking into why the whitespace was being stripped. Looking at the DevTools console, under the sources tab, the `index.js` was compiled like this:

```js
  (/*!*************************!*\
      !*** ./pages/index.tsx ***!
      \*************************/
    /***/
    function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {

        "use strict";
        eval(__webpack_require__.ts("__webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);\n/* harmony export */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, {\n/* harmony export */   \"default\": function() { return /* binding */ Home; }\n/* harmony export */ });\n/* harmony import */ var react_jsx_dev_runtime__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ = __webpack_require__(/*! react/jsx-dev-runtime */ \"./node_modules/react/jsx-dev-runtime.js\");\n/* harmony import */ var react_jsx_dev_runtime__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default = /*#__PURE__*/__webpack_require__.n(react_jsx_dev_runtime__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__);\n\nfunction Home() {\n    return /*#__PURE__*/ (0,react_jsx_dev_runtime__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.jsxDEV)(\"div\", {\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/ (0,react_jsx_dev_runtime__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.jsxDEV)(\"py-script\", {\n            children: \"for i in range(9): print(i) def func(): print('function works')\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: \"/Users/fabiorosado/test/test/pages/index.tsx\",\n            lineNumber: 4,\n            columnNumber: 3\n        }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: \"/Users/fabiorosado/test/test/pages/index.tsx\",\n        lineNumber: 3,\n        columnNumber: 2\n    }, this);\n}\n_c = Home;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Home\");\n\n\n;\n    // Wrapped in an IIFE to avoid polluting the global scope\n    ;\n    (function () {\n        var _a, _b;\n        // Legacy CSS implementations will `eval` browser code in a Node.js context\n        // to extract CSS.

Similarly, if you convert a class component to a\n                    // function, we want to invalidate the boundary.\n                    if (self.$RefreshHelpers$.shouldInvalidateReactRefreshBoundary(prevExports, currentExports)) {\n                        module.hot.invalidate();\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        self.$RefreshHelpers$.scheduleUpdate();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            else {\n                // Since we just executed the code for the module, it's possible that the\n                // new exports made it ineligible for being a boundary.\n                // We only care about the case when we were _previously_ a boundary,\n                // because we already accepted this update (accidental side effect).\n                var isNoLongerABoundary = prevExports !== null;\n                if (isNoLongerABoundary) {\n                    module.hot.invalidate();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    })();\n//# sourceURL=[module]\n//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,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\n//# sourceURL=webpack-internal:///./pages/index.tsx\n"));
    })
```

This may be a bit hard to look into, so lets focus on the pyscript tag itself:

```js
children: \"for i in range(9): print(i) def func(): print('function works')\"\n  }
```

As you can see, all the whitespace was stripped. Also, our Python code was all in the same line.

## Looking into whitespace being stripped

Since this was the result of the compiled code, I thought this might be coming from the compilation step. So I went to the [Babel repl](https://babeljs.io/repl#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&build=&builtIns=false&corejs=3.21&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=DwBwngtAzgxgTgSxAFwHwCgAEmBmB7OTBIgO0zgEMSBzAUwAoBOASgC4tsRETl6Fn06ACa0cuAK4kY9Nh0xcEPegHIckmMgR4yAdwIBrKMoHAA9OGjwkaIA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=env%2Creact%2Cstage-2&prettier=false&targets=&version=7.20.4&externalPlugins=&assumptions=%7B%7D) and pasted the pyscript code, this converted the code into:

```js
"use strict";

/*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("py-script", null, "for i in range(9): print(i) def func(): print('function works')");
```

Interesting, the code is being turned into a `React.createElement`. Looking more into this, I discovered that JSX would strip whitespaces, which was why our Python code was being added to the same line with indentation stripped off.

## Trying to fix the issue

Since the issue was coming from JSX, I thought that perhaps we could handle white space by using `{" "}`, the code inside the `py-script` tag was pretty ugly, but it seemed to work!

```tsx
<py-script>
for i in range(9):{"\n"}
{" "}{" "}print(i){"\n"}
{"\n"}
def func():{"\n"}
{" "}{" "}print('function works'){"\n"}
</py-script>
```

This is a pretty terrible way to write Python. But progress is progress. Looking at the documentation on [React without JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html), it seems we could create a component that should run our code as is without JSX transforming it. If this works, perhaps I could make a `PyScript` component that would skip JSX altogether.

```ts
import React from "react";

export class PyScript extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement("py-script", null, this.props.children);
  }
}
```

Now with this component, I tried to pass the Python code and see if it worked.

```tsx
import { PyScript } from "../components/pyscript"

export default function Home() {
  return (
       <PyScript>
      for i in range(9):
          print(i)
  
      def func():
          print('function works')
      </PyScript>
    )
}
```

Unfortunately, this threw the same error as before. For some reason, the code inside `PyScript` was still being converted. An idea popped into my head. Perhaps I could wrap the contents into a string. In theory, it should work since the component creates the `py-script` tag with the code we are sending.

```tsx
import { PyScript } from "../components/pyscript"

export default function Home() {
  return (
       <PyScript>
       {`
	      for i in range(9):
	          print(i)
	  
	      def func():
	          print('function works')
      `}
      </PyScript>
    )
}
```

This worked with a slight problem. It was running the code twice. Unfortunately, I still need to figure out why this is happening and will need to dig deeper into it.

## The Fix

So far, I have made a lot of progress on how to get pyscript to work in React. The last thing I wanted to try was to use [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml) to see if that could fix the issue of running the code twice.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:
    `
    <py-script>
    for i in range(9):
        print(i)

    def func():
        print('function works')
    </py-script>
    `}}
    />
    )
}
```

Great news! This worked, and ran the code a single time! 

To make things a bit cleaner, I added the PyScript code to its variable and passed it directly to `__html`.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  const pyscript = `
    <py-script>
    for i in range(9):
        print(i)

    def func():
        print('function works')
    </py-script>
  `

  return (
    <div
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: pyscript}}
    />
    )
}
```

Finally, I tried to replace the `div` with the `py-script` tag to see if that would work. Great news! It does!

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  const pyscript = `
    for i in range(9):
        print(i)

    def func():
        print('function works')
  `

  return (
    <py-script
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: pyscript}}
    />
    )
}
```

This is where I stopped digging since it works as expected. I'm planning to look into why the component was causing pyscript to run twice. Once I have an answer, I'll update this post.
