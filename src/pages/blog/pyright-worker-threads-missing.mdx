At [Coiled](https://coiled.io) we use a few hooks that run with `pre-commit`. This means that before git commits your changes, these hooks will be run and report any failures.

This means that before git commits your changes, these hooks will be run and report any failures.  Using `pre-commit` is a great way to spot issues (like linting) before you do your commits.

Everything went fine when I set up my dev environment, the command `pre-commit install` throw no errors when I ran it. But on my first commit, I got an error with `pyright` that apparently couldn't find the `worker_threads` module.


## The Problem

Pyright it's a type checker for Python created by Microsoft. This was the first time I was using `pyright` so I have never encountered the error. 

```shell
pyright..................................................................Failed
- hook id: pyright
- exit code: 1

    throw err;

```

This error made me unable to use pre-commit, which is a bummer because I kept forgetting to run black to automatically check and lint my code. 

After exploring online, it seems that it might be a node issue, I've tried using Node Version Manager to update node to the latest version (15.3.0), but that didn't work. So, I tried to install the latest node version manually, but that didn't work as well.

## The solution

After going through a few StackOverflow questions and Github issues, I came across this GitHub issue created on the electron repository - [Unable to use NodeJs worker-threads module](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18540).

Running this command will be enough to fix the issue.

```shell
export NODE\_OPTIONS=--experimental-worker
```

Now I can run `git commit`, and my pre-commit will run without throwing any errors.
