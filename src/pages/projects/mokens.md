excerpt: Client work to design and code the page for mokens.io, in the end the client decided to just keep the design and not go ahead with the code.

---
The client wanted a design for his project [Mokens](https://mokens.io), which are a digital creation that can be collected and can be viewed, held, transferred and received in crypto wallets.

After a few emails with the client, I proposed the dark theme for the page, the colours used in the design came from the Mokens logo that was already created. The design has grown gradually with the client input and eventually, the light theme was created because the client wanted the website to have the same feeling like another one.

Unfortunately, the client didn't want to go ahead with the full code of the website and decided to pay only for the design since he wasn't sure how he wanted the website to look like.
