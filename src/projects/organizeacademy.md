excerpt: Client website design and code custom css and components. The website is an Academy for empowering women in Portugal.
---
The client asked for a branding, webdesign service for her Academy to empower women in Portugal. After a few meetings and proposals the client and I have agreed on a color scheme and design. I proceeded to build the site and css from grounds up and added the animations to improve the overhall feeling of the site.

Branding wise, I've created two logos for the client. Choose the color scheme and the font to use. I've also created a business card design for the client.

# Overview

- **The Good**
  - Minimal design that looks good
  - Animations give a good feeling when browsing the site
  - Services/Workshop component moves automatically and buttons change color depending on what's selected
- **The Bad**
  - Services layout could be improved
  - Contact form should just sent the email automatically instead of around
  - Primary color doesn't contrast well with the white background.
- **The Ugly**
  - Mobile text on services/workshop needs work - spacing issues
  - Text on contact page should be smaller - keep email on same line
